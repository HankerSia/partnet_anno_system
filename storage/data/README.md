Here is where you put the original ShapeNet parts data. This is not officially released to the public. Please contact [ShapeNet Web Master](mailto:shapenetwebmaster@gmail.com) to request the data.

If `leaf_part_obj_normalized` is not present for each model, please use the following command to preprocess the data first

    python normalize_obj.py Chair

We provide four example data (2 beds and 2 chairs) in this repo.
